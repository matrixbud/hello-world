# hello-world
Retired and teaching myself cosmology. Currently focusing on learning Clifford algebra and so teaching myself Mathematica so I can automate tedious geometric, wedge, and dot multiplications as well as Hodge duals and evntually other GA operations.
I have a first version of the geometric algebra (GA) package and I am right now learning how to use GitHub to share it.
